### Development stages:

### [Frontend] 

* Made the appearance of the form.
* Adapted for mobile devices.
* Wrote a universal script in JS for validating form fields.
* This script will automatically determine that the field is being checked for validity.
* To do this, just add a custom attribute to the input in the HTML markup.
* If the frame value is incorrect, the input fields are highlighted in red, if correct - green.
* The form submit button only works if all fields are filled out correctly.
